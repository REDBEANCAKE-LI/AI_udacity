Artificial Intelligence is also called intelligent agent.
It gets to interact with the environment.
The agent can perceive the state of the environment through its sensors, and affect its state through actuators.

The big question of artificial intelligence is the function that maps sensors to actuators. That is called the control policy for the agent.

The loop of environment feedback to sensors, agent decision, actuator interaction with the environment and so on is called perception action cycle ( PAC ).
